    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This particular ping gai (Laotian for 'grilled chicken') recipe seems to
      have originated from the Queen Mother Cafe in Toronto, so some
      North-Americanization may have occurred. But rest assured, this is at
      least twice as good as your average grilled chicken, North American or
      otherwise. Generous amounts of freshly ground pepper and chopped cilantro
      are the main players in the marinade, while a sweet, garlicky dipping
      sauce is the perfect accompaniment.
